My task is to analyze the neighborhoods of Toronto to determine where would be the best location for my client to open their second shop.    \n\nTo help my client succeed in their business, besides their management, the location of the shop is also critical. I tend to pick an environment that is very similar to where they have their first coffee shop. In such way, their second coffee shop will likely to attract similar customers, and they can expect similar business performance, similar traffic or even similar competitors. In conclusion I want to find which neighborhood is the most similar to my client\u2019s current neighborhood, to open the second coffee shop.  \n\nTo answer this question, first I will analyze the venue information in each neighborhood using the Foursquare location data, focusing on those drink and food venues. Next, build a machine learning model to segment neighborhoods in Toronto. The clustering technique, k-means, will be used for this task. Finally I will examine and pick the most suitable neighborhood for my client\u2019s second coffee shop.  \n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Data\n\nData required for this project includes:\n\n* Postal, borough, and neighborhood of Canada from [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M), from where I will filter out the Toronto neighborhood only. \n* Latitude and longitude info of each neighborhood from [here](https://cocl.us/Geospatial_data). \n* Nearby venue data extracted from Foursquare database, \n    * focus on those coffee shop, food, and drinks related venues. \n    * Rating of each coffee shop.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
